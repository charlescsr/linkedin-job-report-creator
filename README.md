# LinkedIn Job Report Creator

This program creates a PDF including the origional post with graphs of the most used language from scraping a LinkedIn job post using Python.

## Why?
I created this while on my own job search as it can be time consuming to read and analyize job posts to know how to tweak your resume accordingly. I wanted to share this with others who are in the job market and want to help eaze the process!


## Whats in the Report
- Date @ top right
- Role, Company and City in bold @ top center
- Descrtiption of role
- Horizontal barchart of 10 most common nouns + 10 most common verbs (you can change to your liking).
- Pie chart of 10 most common nouns
- Pie chart of 10 most common verbs

*Note: you can change the number of verbs/nouns to your liking*

Now run `main.py` and when prompted paste the url and then what you would like the file to be named. 

*Note: the program will automatically add `.pdf` after.*

In a couple seconds your report will be done and saved in to your desktop!
